     * <p>
     * Method created to replace the {@link org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils} implementation, because the 
     * original sometimes failed to copy a file in its entirety (output file size was smaller than input).
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * This code was adapted from the original implementation and the suggestion at 
     * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20143054/copying-xml-file-from-url-returns-incomplete-file . 
     * </p>
     * Copies bytes from an {@link InputStream} <code>source</code> to a file
     * <code>destination</code>. The directories up to <code>destination</code>
     * will be created if they don't already exist. <code>destination</code>
     * will be overwritten if it already exists.
     * The {@code source} stream is closed.
     * See {@link #copyToFile(InputStream, File)} for a method that does not close the input stream.
     *
     * @param source      the <code>InputStream</code> to copy bytes from, must not be {@code null}, will be closed
     * @param destination the non-directory <code>File</code> to write bytes to
     *                    (possibly overwriting), must not be {@code null}
     * @throws IOException if <code>destination</code> is a directory
     * @throws IOException if <code>destination</code> cannot be written
     * @throws IOException if <code>destination</code> needs creating but can't be
     * @throws IOException if an IO error occurs during copying
